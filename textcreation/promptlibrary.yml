    Select mostly individual words of the original, but phrases when it makes sense. You may need to use multiple words in english to capture the nuances of the Danish.

    The text you will be examining will be from Henrik Ibsen who wrote in Danish-Norwegian, so you may need to use some Norwegian words or phrases in your translation and make modifications accordingly. The goal is to appreciate Ibsen in his own nuanced language rather than strictly Danish.
